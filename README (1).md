# Temperature-tracker

- A web-app created by me, to track temperature changes over a period of last 30 days.
- It extracts data from my Heroku cloud database, and displays it in a visual way.
- It also shows the temperature prediction for the next days
- I used FastAPI to create this web-app and jinja2 for templating
- The site is deployed on Heroku



## Deployment
